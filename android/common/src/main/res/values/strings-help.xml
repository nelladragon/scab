\n\nThe app has “in app” purchases. This allows you to donate to the continued
development of the app. I think the donation model is better than having
advertising in the app or charging for the app before you can use it.
All donations are much appreciated.

\n\nIf you have some questions about the app, please send me an email using the
Feedback menu option.
