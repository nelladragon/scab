Shower Timer Talking uses Android’s Text To Speech engine to talk,
so the talking is more than a little robotic. If you use an Android
version prior to 5.0, you will be might be asked to install a
“high quality text to speech” engine. If you choose to do this, the
quality of the speaking will be better.

\n\nThe app allows you to set your name and profile photo using Facebook
or Google login. If you choose to use this feature, the app does not
collect any data from these services beyond your username and profile photo.

\n\nThe app has “in app” purchases. This allows you to donate to the continued
development of the app. I think the donation model is better than having
advertising in the app or charging for the app before you can use it.
All donations are much appreciated.

\n\nIf you have some questions about the app, please send me an email using the
Feedback menu option.
