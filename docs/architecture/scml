# Smart Contract Mark-up Language

Initially, this page will list some general thoughts:


Need the following sections which equate to tabs within the application.
* <startup> Initialization code. The code in this section could make read calls from the blockchain to determine how the GUI should be displayed.
* <main> If there is no start-up, or if an error occurs, then the main tab should be displayed.
* <about> This should indicate the author of the Dapp.
* <code> Should there always be a code tab? For normal users, how useful would this tab be? However, is this tab equivalent to having access to the terms and conditions in a normal application?

The details of the language are to be defined, but will be like simple HTML and simple Javascript.
